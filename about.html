      <h2>Hi! I'm Ali Kayra Ilhan</h2>

      
      <p>A passionate Computer Engineering student based in Ankara, Turkey, with a growing interest in game development and mobile applications.</p>
        
      <p>My journey into the world of software started with a love for technology and creativity, which naturally led me to explore game development using C++ and Unity. I'm currently pursuing my degree while actively working on personal projects that strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming, design patterns, and interactive game mechanics.
        
        Alongside game development, I’m also diving into mobile app development with React Native, aiming to bring meaningful, well-designed applications to life. I'm particularly interested in building engaging user experiences and systems that are both efficient and scalable.</p>
        
        <p>My goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of creating innovative digital experiences—from immersive games to practical mobile apps. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tools, solving programming challenges, or learning about the latest trends in software and game development.
